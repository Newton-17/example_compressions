# Compression

## Description
	The goal of this repository is to explore different compression algorithms
and their benefits/cons. How they apply to different data types (video, audio, text, etc...)
These will all be simple implementations mostly written at a high level in python/java but may
explore utilizing some lower level languages like C.

## Compression Algorithms
* Huffman Algorithm
* Fano
* LZ4

# Implemented
...

# Runtime in other languages

# Run w/ callback to unix library for native packages
